// Immediate operations, when added to an RSTOperationQueue, are performed immediately and synchronously.
// Essentially, immediate operations act the same as if they were synchronous operations started outside of an operation queue.
// Because of this, they block whatever thread they were added to the operation queue on, so be careful!
